How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
We couldn't find any collaborative wireframing tools so we just had one person due it while the other saw through screen share. It was a little difficult but if you are like me and don't really have any preference on specifics it is actually easy. I feel like it would also be a lot easier if we were in person as opposed to doing it remotely.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Wireframing is helpful. It basically is a guideline to what you will be doing in html. Without it, when you are doing the html coding it could be cumbersome and hard to handle.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
We decided that there needed to be a footer, an aside, a title as well as content.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?	
I learned how to make an aside as well as putting lists within lists.

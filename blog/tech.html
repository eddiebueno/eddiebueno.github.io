     Big O notation is used to describe the complexity of an algorithm. It describes the worst case scenerio that can be used to describe the execution of the algorithm.

      There are different notaions that can be used to describe the worst case. O(1) or big o of 1 describes an algorithm that will take the same time to perform all the time. No matter the size of the data it will always take constant time. O(n) describes an algorithm that performs in proportional to the size of the data inputted. O(n^2) describes an algorithm to be the square of the size of the input set, meaning it would have to go through the same set twice, usually in nested loops. O(2^n) doubles the growth of each additional input included in the set. This is considered very slow and not the most efficient way to go about things. There is also O(log(n)) where only half the data set can be used. Since the worst case is log(n) it is much better than n.

      When an algorithm is run, it takes time to finish the task. Now when you input something to this algorithm it will calculate the data using loops, an other tools that was programmed into it. Having loops within loops can case an algorithm to run very slowly. Where as comparing the input data to something can decrease the number of loops it runs throuhg significantly. If someone were to use large amounts of data to calculate something, it would be better to do it at constant speed (O(1)) but that is not always possible. Constant time would only work for things like finding the end of an array or sting. Or somethin specific no matter the size of the input. This would be special circumstances.

      When we talk about worst case scenerio, we are talking about the worst possible input we could give this algorithm. An algorthim asking for an even number in an array could give the first number in that array if that first number happened to be even. But the worst case is that it went through all of the array in order to find that even number. So in this example it could run from O(1) to O(n). Knowing what big o really does can help you when you program and code projects that rely on large amounts of data. It will help you in the long run.

     Well hello there. This is my about me. To start off I guess I'll say where I'm from. I was born in Southern California. Grew up in a city called Montebello right next to East LA. Focused a lot on school and ending up going to the University of California Berkeley where I majored in Civil Engineering. However it was a little too much for me and I ended up getting kicked out due to personal reasons and stress. As of now my future goals include to continue my success in programming and mix it with the knowledge I have learned at Cal. I hope to finally graduate and go into the work field so I can better the Civil engineering field.

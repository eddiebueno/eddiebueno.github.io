What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned that padding is something that automatically happens. It is like a buffer between items in html and where they are. Borders also have a similar function in which there needs to be some buffer zone between the content it is bordering. You can have it so there is no buffer zone however. Margin's are the spaces between the edges of the sides in which the content is placed.


What did you learn about CSS positioning?
Not much to be honest. The concept seemed over my head. Although what I am getting from it is that it is important. There are different types of positioning. These include static, relative, and a few others. I know for sure that static is when one does not move from it's place. Relative is positioning froma relative point. 

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The easiest to element would be color, size, and alignment of the text. The hardest part would be the alignment and place of everythin. I am still unsure of how to do that but I think with the 4 hours and effort I put into my blog I did the best I could. I know my blog still is not the best but I know it will only get better from here.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned that you can format elements through CSS. This is like taking a part of the html code and changing the specifications of it. There are a huge amoount of ways in which the elements can be changed.

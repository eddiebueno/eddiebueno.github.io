  <h2>JavaScript For Loop vs Ruby For Loop</h2>

     I'll start off by explaining what a for loop is. A for loop is a loop where it will iterate "for" a certain amount of time that you give it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for ruby, a for loop is used the same way. The syntax for a ruby for loop would  be for i in 0..3 which is all. The i is an index variable which could be any variable. In says the range in which the index will be used in. It starts at the nmber right after the in. The .. tells us that it is inbetween the first and last digit. The .. means the last digit is included while if a ... is used it means the last digit is not used. In the for loop the index i needs to be manually changed while it iterates. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for JavaScript, the syntax looks like for (i =0; i < max; i++). The first part, i = 0, tells you where the index i starts. The second parts tells the where the index will go up to or the max value it will go up to. Using < will not include it while =< will include the number. The last part will tell you at what increment the index will change. This example shows that the index is going to increase 1 each time it iterates. 
    </p>

      Using a for loop can be difficult if you are not sure about the increments. I feel like I got the hang of a for loop so easy. I can use a for loop for just about anything. When you do your pseudocode and you use the word "for" chances are you can use a for loop. Not all the time, but probably most of the time.

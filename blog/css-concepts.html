      What is the difference between margin, border, and padding?


      Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
      Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
      Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
      Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

      Essentially, you have your content. Now that content is going to take up a certain amount of space. Then padding is a buffer zone around this content which is transparent. Around the padding is the border which  goes around the padding. Finally the margin is another transparent area that is a buffer for the border. The picture below should give you a clear understanding of these concepts.

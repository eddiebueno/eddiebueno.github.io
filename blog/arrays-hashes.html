  <h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>

      What are arrays and hashes? Well to put it simple. An array is something that holds objects in a specific order. Where as a hash is a collection of objects sorted by keywords. Think of a has like a dictionary, and yes some other languages use the word dictionary instead of hash but they are pretty much the same.

       Now why would you use one over the other? Simple, time and accesibility. Arrays can get pretty long. It is just a line of objects that you have stored. Think of it like placing a box on top of each other. If you want to get to the bottom box you have to move all the other boxes to get to it. Now this is not always the case, you see in an array each object is indexed by the position it is in the array. If it is in the first spot it is indexed 0, the second would be 1 and so on. From this you can easily get to an object if you know the index. If you don't know the index then it could take awhile.

        Hashes on the other hand is just a collection of objects so the time it takes to get to one object is constant meaning all you have to do is put the keyword in and you get your object. It is consistent throughout. An example of using a hash over an array would be if you are making a grocery list at a super market and you are trying to find how much everything is. You can set the items cost as the object and then set the keyword as the items name. So for a banana I would put it at 0.50 cents with the keyword banana. If I want to know how much a banana is I can just look up banana and it will give me 0.50. The main this about hashes is that every object has to have a unique keyword. You can not assign a keyword to two different objects. So it is impossible to have banana be 0.50 and 1.00 at the same time. You can include this in an array if you like. That is ana advantage of having an array over a hash. If you order your array in a specific order, whether it be from low to high, or alphabetical, then your time to go through the array significantly decreases. And by having multiple items that are the same you can distinguish the differences with the indexes.

        Well I hope you learned something about hashes and arrays. They are amazing tools that are used in programming and can be helpful to you.

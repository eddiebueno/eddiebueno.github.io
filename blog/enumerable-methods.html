     An enumerable mixin gives collection classes several transversal and searching methods. These methods can differ from adding to each, or to mapping a specific equation to each element. I will try and do my best to explain the Enumerable#map for you.

      The Enumerable#map is basically something you would use if you would like to apply something on to all objects you have. Mapping in general is the idea of applying something to a list of objects. For example say if I have a list of numbers. Let's call it an array of numbers. Now say the array goes from 1 to 5. Now what would we do if we want to have each of our numbers doubled? Well we would map a *2 to our array. We could just call our array with .map{|obj| *2}

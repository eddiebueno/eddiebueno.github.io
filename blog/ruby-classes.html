     Classes are first class objects in the ruby language. They are the objects that basically run a lot of things when you code. A class is an object that can have multiple methods attached to it. Any class that is made will be an instance of the Class object.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you make a new class it is good practice to capitalize it so you can distiguish it from methods and other objects. It is also good practice to make sure your methods in your class are readable and use _ when there are multiple words.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you create a method in a class, you can call it by saying The_Class.method. calling it with . allows you to use the method. There are other things you can do with . and that is calling instance variables. Now instance variables are variables that can only be accessed through that instance of that class.
